# Project Topic: Movie Review Website

# Abstract

The idea behind our project is all based on movie user ratings. So, our website will be forum-based, where users can create, read, update, or delete posts. There will be other aspects to the website, which we will decide on and implement as we go along, but an example could be the user ratings for the most recently released movie, or we can showcase the most liked movies, etc. 

We will use a MySQL database to store the users' data, including their credentials, comments, posts, and everything. For the most part, we will be using javascript libraries and frameworks to build the frontend and backend.
